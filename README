NanQ is a Japanese Kanji analysation program written in Haskell.
Its main function is to tell what Kanji belong to what Level
of the 漢字検定, or in English, the Japanese National Kanji
Examination. 

NanQ can be used to:
 - determine what Level individual Kanji belong to, should a user
   become curious.
 - determine the average Level (difficulty, in other words)
   of a group of Kanji.
 - apply the above to whole files of Japanese.
 - display the results of all the above in Japanese or English.

INSTALLING NANQ
---------------
First, get the source files from:

https://github.com/fosskers/nanq

NanQ is written in Haskell, thus one needs to have Haskell installed
as well. To install NanQ system-wide, move to the source directory and do:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure
runhaskell Setup.hs build
sudo runhaskell Setup.hs install

This will install NanQ into /usr/local/bin/.

USING NANQ
----------
Assuming you've made it so that you can run the executable,
the following command-line options are available:

 *no option*      Takes a line of Japanese straight from the
     		    command line and gives the Level of each Kanji.
 -a, --average    Given Japanese input, finds the average Level of
     		    all Kanji present.
 -u, --unknowns   Reports Kanji whose Level could not be determined.
 -h, --help       Prints a message explaining these options.
 -d, --leveldist  Find the % distribution of Levels in given Japanese.
 -k, --density    Determines how much of the input is made up of Kanji.
 -e, --elementary Determines how much of the input is made up of Kanji
     		    leared in Japanese Elementary School.
 -q, --fromq      Filters out all but Kanji from the requested Level.
 -f, --file       Get input from a given file.
 -p, --pipe       Get input from stdin.
 -j, --japanese   Gives output in Japanese where available.

-Notes on CLOs-
Either `-f` or `-p` can be used on top of any other option.
`-j` will change output to Japanese and can be combined with any option.
`-h` will over-ride any other options or arguments, discarding them and
printing a help message.

-Examples-
*Single Kanji*
nanq 日
>>> 日 is a Level 10.0 Kanji
nanq -j 日
>>> 「日」は10.0級の漢字

*A Japanese sentence*
nanq これは日本語
>>> 日 is a Level 10.0 Kanji
    本 is a Level 10.0 Kanji
    語 is a Level 9.0 Kanji

*Averages*
nanq -a この文は難しくない
>>> 7.5
nanq -a 此の文は難儀だと思える
>>> 5.63

*Reading from a file (and also finding the average)*
nanq -fa file.txt

*Reading from stdin (and getting output in Japanese)*
cat file.txt | nanq -pj
