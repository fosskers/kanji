NANQ

NanQ is a Japanese Kanji analysation program written in Haskell.
Its main function is to tell what Kanji belong to what Level
of the 漢字検定, or in English, the Japanese National Kanji
Examination. 

NanQ can be used to:
 - determine what Level individual Kanji belong to, should a user
   become curious.
 - determine the average Level (difficulty, in other words)
   of a group of Kanji.
 - apply the above to whole files of Japanese.
 - display the results of all the above in Japanese or English.

NanQ will in future be able to:
 - tell how much of a group of Kanji belongs to each Level,
   as a percentage.

INSTALLING NANQ
---------------
First, get the source and data files from:

https://github.com/fosskers/nanq

Then, moving to the directory where you placed the source files,
compile NanQ as follows:

  ghc nanq.hs -O2

Of course you need Haskell installed in order for this to work.

As of April 02 2012, there is not yet any build script or the like,
and the executable needs to be in the same folder as the `data`
folder. This will change eventually.

USING NANQ
----------
As the executable needs to be in the same folder as the `data`
folder, I use the current hack in my .bashrc to run NanQ.

alias nanq='cd pathToExecutable/ && ./nanq'

Again, this will be changed so NanQ can be run normally
without any extra work after install.

Assuming you've made it so that you can run the executable,
the following command-line options are available:

 *no option*     Takes a line of Japanese straight from the
     		   command line and gives the Level of each Kanji.
 -a, --average   Given Japanese input, finds the average Level of
     		   all Kanji present.
 -u, --unknowns  Reports Kanji whose Level could not be determined.
 -h, --help      Prints a message explaining these options.
 -f, --file      Get input from a given file.
 -p, --pipe      Get input from stdin.
 -j, --japanese  Gives output in Japanese where available.

-Notes on CLOs-
Either `-f` or `-p` can be used on top of any other option.
`-j` will change output to Japanese and can be combined with any option.
`-h` will over-ride any other options or arguments, discarding them and
printing a help message.

-Examples-
*Single Kanji*
nanq 日
>>> 日 is a Level 10.0 Kanji
nanq -j 日
>>> 「日」は10.0級の漢字

*A Japanese sentence*
nanq これは日本語
>>> 日 is a Level 10.0 Kanji
    本 is a Level 10.0 Kanji
    語 is a Level 9.0 Kanji

*Averages*
nanq -a この文は難しくない
>>> 7.5
nanq -a 此の文は難儀だと思える
>>> 5.63

*Reading from a file (and also finding the average)*
nanq -fa file.txt

*Reading from stdin (and getting output in Japanese)*
cat file.txt | nanq -pj

IF NOTHING ELSE
---------------
If nothing else, there are lists of Kanji divided by Level in text
files in the `data` folder. The Kanji are sorted in the order of
their Unicode numbers. Feel free to use these lists as you wish,
as after much searching I was able to find no similar compilation
of lists that is _easily accessable_. The company that creates
the Kanji Examination offers pretty PDFs, but no dead simple
text files.
