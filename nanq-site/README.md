This is a website for learners and native speakers of Japanese to analyse
bodies of Japanese text for difficultly. Here we measure difficulty by
a number of factors:

* Density of Kanji vs non-Kanji in the text
* Density of Kanji learned in Japanese elementary school within the text
* Appearance of Kanji from higher levels of the [Japan Kanji Aptitude Test]()
(Kanken)

Want to read a book or manga, and would like to know up-front what Kanji
you'll need to learn?

Want to be better prepared for your next Kanken?

Interested in finding out how hard a "hard" text really is?

[Then head over to the site](http://www.nanq.ca)

*This website is written completely in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
and is powered by the
[servant](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[kanji](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kanji) libraries.*
