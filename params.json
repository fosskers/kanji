{"name":"NanQ","body":"NANQ\r\n----\r\nNanQ is a Japanese Kanji analysation program written in Haskell.\r\nIts main function is to tell what Kanji belong to what Level\r\nof the 漢字検定, or in English, the Japanese National Kanji\r\nExamination. \r\n\r\nNanQ can be used to:\r\n\r\n - determine what Level individual Kanji belong to, should a user\r\n   become curious.\r\n\r\n - determine the average Level (difficulty, in other words)\r\n   of a group of Kanji.\r\n\r\n - apply the above to whole files of Japanese.\r\n\r\n - display the results of all the above in Japanese or English.\r\n\r\nNanQ will in future be able to:\r\n\r\n - tell how much of a group of Kanji belongs to each Level,\r\n   as a percentage.\r\n\r\nIF NOTHING ELSE\r\n---------------\r\nIf nothing else, there are lists of Kanji divided by Level in text\r\nfiles in the `data` folder. The Kanji are sorted in the order of\r\ntheir Unicode numbers. Feel free to use these lists as you wish,\r\nas after much searching I was able to find no similar compilation\r\nof lists that is _easily accessable_. The company that creates\r\nthe Kanji Examination offers pretty PDFs, but no dead simple\r\ntext files.","tagline":"Haskell program for determining what 級 (level) of the 漢字検定 (national Kanji exam) a given Kanji belongs to.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
